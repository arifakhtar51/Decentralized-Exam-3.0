EXAM 3.0 - Secure Exam Management System
========================================

**EXAM 3.0** is a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform for managing exams. The system ensures exam papers are securely stored on IPFS using the Pinata cloud service and deployed on a private blockchain (using Hardhat). The system automates exam paper access at scheduled times in exam centers using a client application, and candidates can register through the website.

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
*   [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
*   [Pinata Account](https://www.pinata.cloud/)

### 1\. Clone the Repository

   git clone https://github.com/arifakhtar51/HackIndia-Spark-7-priority_queue.git 
   cd HackIndia-Spark-7-priority_queue
    

### 2\. Install Dependencies

    npm install

Smart Contract Deployment
-------------------------

### 1\. Hardhat Setup

Run the following command to start the Hardhat local blockchain:

    npx hardhat node

### 2\. Deploy Contracts

In another terminal, deploy the contracts:

    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

### 3\. View Deployed Contract

You can view the deployed contract address in the `./scripts/deploy.js` file and interact with the contract using `ethers.js`.

Frontend Setup
--------------

1\. **React and Next.js Configuration**: The frontend is built using Next.js to ensure SEO optimization and server-side rendering. Customize the user experience by updating the components in the `./pages` directory.

2\. Run the Frontend:

    npm run dev

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### User Portal

Users can log in, register, and view their exam-related information on the portal. The portal fetches data from MySQL using a REST API.

IPFS and Pinata Integration
---------------------------

### 1\. Setup Pinata API

*   Create an account on [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).
*   Get your **API Key** and **Secret Key** from the Pinata dashboard.
*   Update the `.env` file with the Pinata keys:

    PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
    PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
    

### 2\. Upload Exam Papers to IPFS

Admins can upload exam papers via the admin panel, which will automatically pin the files to IPFS using the Pinata cloud service.

Database and WordPress Integration
----------------------------------

### 1\. MySQL Setup

Set up a MySQL database on your local machine or use a cloud-based MySQL service. Configure the MySQL connection in the `.env` file:

    MYSQL_HOST=localhost
    MYSQL_USER=root
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
    MYSQL_DB=exam_3_0
    

### 2\. WordPress Integration

WordPress is used for content management, allowing users to register via WordPress and manage their profiles. Ensure the necessary WordPress plugins are installed and the MySQL database is synced for smooth integration.
